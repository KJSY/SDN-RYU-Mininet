# SDN-RYU-Mininet
Help me plz T_T

This is my first task.
I need your knowledge.

Frist,
I'm trying to build an SDN enviroment through a RYU controller on MININET.
and It configures an environment of about five random IP, one Controller, and five Server(Handlers).

Second,
I want to build an environment that changes from the existing RR(Round Robin) method to the
1:1 IP mapping method when a large amout of data is generated from a specific IP

Third,
I'm trying to build an environment that returns to the existing RR method when the data is 
normalized again.

* The standard for data explosing is about 150% based on the average waiting time of the server 
  for existing data processing.
